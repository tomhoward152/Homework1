# Homework1

## Description
This project tasked me with improving Horiseon's website through their HTML and CSS. Horiseon is a marketing agency seeking to have a website that is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards. In order to do this, I cleaned up code, added semantic tags, removed redundancy, and corrected errors. Horiseons website is now fully functional and optimized for search engines and up to accessibility standards.

## Takeaways
This project got me to think about many key components of building a website. 
* clear labeling is a must for the next developer 
* a well structured and clearly defined stylesheet makes making changes/cleaning up issues much faster and easier
* properly labeled elements on a page improve you page's performance on search engines and also make your page more accessible
* the basics can be some of the most important things to remember in development and small mistakes/oversights can lead to very large issues
